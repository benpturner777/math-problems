## How to run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Install **NumPy** if not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

All outputs are printed directly to the console.

## Problems solved
The code has been written to solve the following problems. However, variables can easily be adapted to solve the problems for different integers.

1. **Sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000**
2. **Sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to 4 million**
3. **Largest prime factor of a given number**
4. **Largest palindromic number from the product of two 3-digit numbers**
5. **Smallest positive number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20**
6. **Difference between the sum of squares and square of the sum (first 100 numbers)**
7. **10001st prime number**
8. **Largest product of 13 adjacent digits in a number string**
9. **Pythagorean triple whose sum is 1000**
10. **Sum of all primes below 2 million**
11. **(Skipped number 11 in code)**
12. **First triangle number with over 500 divisors**
